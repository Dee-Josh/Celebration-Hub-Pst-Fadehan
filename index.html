                                Wao! Another year has rolled bye. I thank God for sparing your life because the devil tried but he failed woefully because we have a living God. I pray that yo see many more wonderful years on earth. The Lord that has been by your side will not leave nor forsake you. You will continue to live to see your grand children.
Happy birthday sir
